# Dashboard File Fix for Raahi

## Issue
When navigating through the application, users were encountering an error:
```
The file "c:\Users\mishr\OneDrive\Desktop\Raahi-v1.0.1-main\dashboard.html" cannot be found. It may have been moved, edited, or deleted.
```

## Root Cause
The application was referencing `dashboard.html` in some places, but this file was missing from the project directory. The actual dashboard functionality is in `Untitled-5.html`.

## Solution

### Created Redirect File
Created a `dashboard.html` file that automatically redirects to `Untitled-5.html` (the actual dashboard page):

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Dashboard - Raahi</title>
    <script>
        // Redirect to the actual dashboard page
        window.location.href = 'Untitled-5.html';
    </script>
</head>
<body>
    <p>Redirecting to dashboard...</p>
</body>
</html>
```

## Files Created
1. Created `dashboard.html` (redirect to Untitled-5.html)

## Result
Users should now be able to navigate through the application without encountering "file not found" errors when the application tries to load dashboard.html.

## Recommendation
For better maintainability, consider renaming the files to more descriptive names:
- `Untitled-1.html` → `find-ride.html`
- `Untitled-2.html` → `offer-ride.html`
- `Untitled-3.html` → `login.html`
- `Untitled-4.html` → `profile.html`
- `Untitled-5.html` → `dashboard.html`
- `Untitled-6.html` → `profile-completion.html`
- `Untitled-9.html` → `my-rides.html`

This would make the codebase easier to understand and maintain.
