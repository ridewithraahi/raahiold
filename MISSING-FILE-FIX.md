# Missing File Fix for Raahi

## Issue
When clicking on "Find" or other navigation elements, users were encountering an error:
```
The file "c:\Users\mishr\OneDrive\Desktop\Raahi-v1.0.1-main\Untitled-3.html" cannot be found. It may have been moved, edited, or deleted.
```

## Root Cause
The application was referencing `Untitled-3.html` in multiple places, but this file was missing from the project directory.

## Solution

### 1. Created Missing File
Created the missing `Untitled-3.html` file by copying the content from `login.html`, as it appears to be a duplicate login page used throughout the application.

### 2. Fixed Dashboard References
Updated references to `dashboard.html` (which also doesn't exist) to point to `Untitled-5.html` (the actual dashboard page) in:
- `login.html`
- `Untitled-3.html`

## Files Modified/Created
1. Created `Untitled-3.html` (login page)
2. Updated `login.html` (redirects to Untitled-5.html instead of dashboard.html)
3. Updated `Untitled-3.html` (redirects to Untitled-5.html instead of dashboard.html)

## Result
Users should now be able to navigate through the application without encountering "file not found" errors.

## Recommendation
For better maintainability, consider renaming the files to more descriptive names:
- `Untitled-3.html` → `login.html`
- `Untitled-5.html` → `dashboard.html`
- `Untitled-6.html` → `profile-completion.html`

This would make the codebase easier to understand and maintain.
