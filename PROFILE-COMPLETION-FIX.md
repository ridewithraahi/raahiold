# Profile Completion Fix for Raahi

## Issue
Users were being redirected to the profile completion page every time they logged in, even if they had already completed their profile.

## Root Cause
The issue was caused by a discrepancy in property naming:
- The profile completion page (Untitled-6.html) was setting `profileComplete: true` when a user completed their profile
- However, the login page and other pages were checking for `profile.isProfileComplete` (with the "is" prefix)

## Solution

### 1. Updated Login Redirections
Modified the login.html file to check for both property names:
```javascript
if (profile && (profile.profileComplete || profile.isProfileComplete)) {
    window.location.href = 'dashboard.html';
} else {
    window.location.href = 'complete-profile.html';
}
```

### 2. Enhanced Profile Page Check
Updated the profile page (Untitled-4.html) to check for both property names:
```javascript
if (!profile || !(profile.profileComplete || profile.isProfileComplete)) {
    // Profile not complete, redirect to profile completion page
    window.location.href = 'complete-profile.html';
    return;
}
```

### 3. Improved Profile Completion Page
Modified the profile completion page (Untitled-6.html) to check if the profile is already complete and redirect to the dashboard if it is:
```javascript
// If profile is already complete, redirect to dashboard
if (profile.profileComplete || profile.isProfileComplete) {
    console.log('Profile already complete, redirecting to dashboard');
    window.location.href = 'Untitled-5.html'; // Redirect to dashboard
    return;
}
```

## Files Modified
1. login.html
2. Untitled-6.html (Profile completion page)
3. Untitled-4.html (Profile page)

## Result
Users will now only need to complete their profile once. After completing their profile, they will be redirected to the dashboard on subsequent logins.
